TeachStarter Weather App

Hi TeachStarter Team!

There are a few things needed for this application, you will need to navigate into the weather-app folder and run the following commands:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
-----------------------------------------------------------------
npm run start
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You will also have to grant location access in your browser (you should receive a prompt). 
Other than that, you can use the dropdown to select the city, or click on the temperature to swap between metric/imperial units.

I look forward to meeting with you today,

Kind Regards,

Harvey Goldsmith.
